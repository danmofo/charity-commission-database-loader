Charity Commission Database Loader
---

This program downloads the [list of registered charities in England and Wales](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/register/full-register-download) and imports them into a database.

## Usage

1. Copy `.env.template` and fill in the values
2. Execute `./run`, this will compile and run the program.

## TODO
- Add software requirements
- Dockerise so things aren't required to be on your computer
- Write tests
- Add more options
	- Make download URL configurable
